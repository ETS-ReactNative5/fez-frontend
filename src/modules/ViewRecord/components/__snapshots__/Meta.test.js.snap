    content="The International Meeting on Measurements and Hydraulics of Sewers (IMMHS'08) was organised by the Water and Environment Division of the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussées (LCPC) to foster interactions between industry professionals, researchers and university academics on the topics of experiences and challenges in sewers including measurements, hydrodynamics and sediments. A main feature of the meeting was the direct interactions between a wide range of professionals and researchers working on a broad range of relevant topics, including operational issues, sediments and turbidity, mud rheology, H2S, and flow measurements. Another interesting aspect of this event was the stimulating debates during and after the presentations, as well as during the subsequent discussions and the field measurements. Contributions include: Challenges in Sewer Hydrodynamics, Sediments and Measurements, Sedimentation in Large Combined Sewage Systems: Perspectives of an Operator, A New Velocity and Total Suspended Solid Measurement Device, Measurements of Pollutants by Turbidimetry, Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) in the Field and in Laboratory: Practical Experiences, Sewer Sediments - their Diversity, Impact and Modelling Challenges, Use of CFD Techniques to Estimate the Spatial Distribution of Sediment on the Bed of a Large Detention and Settling Basin. The publication of the proceedings marked the successful conclusion of this event. Each paper was peer-reviewed by a minimum of two experts. A key feature of all these contributions is the practical knowledge gained in the last ten to fifteen years, and a particular effort was made by all contributors to share both positive and negative experiences."

    content="The project is an exploration in the role of the garden as a means of generating a sense of place and to become a key focus in the formation and memory of a dwelling. The project is situated in Latvia, in the suburb of Meshaparks, an old established suburb of Riga. The suburb is characterized by larger lot sizes with villas set amongst trees. In the early 1930's Scandinavian functionalist architecture came to prominence and continued in popularity for a short period, dying out in the mid 1930's. The subject project involved the restoration of an existing timber functionalist house designed in 1933 by the architect Lidija Hofmane-Grinberga and constructed in the same year. The site also contained two outbuildings designed and constructed in the mid and late 1980's The project aimed to draw out the latent potential of the site circumstance that comprised the sunny garden hidden from the street and buildings that enclosed the garden to create an informal yet enclosed space that became in effect the major outdoor \\"room\\" of the house. The design draws inspiration from traditional Latvian farmhouse courtyard gardens, Japanese enclosed gardens as well as the work of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto."

    content="Despite a National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development and the embodiment of this in numerous national and state statues, environmental degradation continues to occur on rural land. This raises the question of how the primary land managers in Queensland perceive sustainable development. Australia’s early reliance on agricultural production and international markets contributed substantially to the extensive environmental degradation that has occurred. Consequently economic and environmental issues have dominated the research on sustainable development, with the social dimension relatively neglected. In addition, despite the large quantity of work that has been conducted with farmers and graziers, little is known about how either of these types of land managers interpret sustainable development. The aim of this thesis was to develop an in-depth understanding of graziers’ perceptions of sustainable development to make a contribution to this area. An exploratory interpretative approach was taken to conduct this investigation because previous research had been limited. In-depth unstructured interviews were conducted with 57 Queensland graziers in the tropical savannas in a case study with two locations – the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Central West. This approach was supported by participant observation and a brief questionnaire to provide background information. The fieldwork was conducted over a period of five months which allowed analysis to be conducted as the study progressed. Most of the graziers were interviewed on their properties with the goal of adding richness to the data and assisting with interpretation. Several bodies of literature have been used to interpret the results of this study. Areas of the sustainable development literature relevant to this thesis are reviewed to provide a context for the thesis. The literature on structural change in Australian agriculture provides a background to the broad influences on the agricultural sector and farmers. Also reviewed are the approaches taken to change the land management practices of farmers. The enduring value of farming and the changing values of rural land use are explored through a review of agrarianism, the goals and values of farmers and the post-productivist transition. The results for both study locations showed that these graziers preference the economic dimension of sustainable development over the environmental and social dimensions. The rationale for this preference is that maintaining economic viability will allow them to achieve their social goal – to continue their preferred way of life. A strong focus therefore, is on economic viability as a means to a social end. The objective is to overcome the constraints of being market and season dependent and the costs of operating in rural and remote locations through a whole-of-enterprise business management approach. The need for graziers to continue increasing their productivity to remain economically viable and to continue being competitive in international markets, challenges their ability to balance the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. For some the environmental dimension of sustainable development may be compromised to accommodate their economic priorities and social goals. A perceived future threat, more so for Gulf graziers, arises from the belief that they and their interests are marginalised through consultation processes. This contributes to their belief that the government prioritises Aboriginal land rights and environmental protection interests over their production interests. They believe that if this continues their future is at risk through further decreases to the security of their tenure. The results of this study suggest that a more innovative and integrated approach will be required to meet the challenges of sustainable development in these areas, in early twenty-first century Australia. The holistic approach from a social science perspective has provided an understanding of what graziers value and why. These insights contribute to knowledge of how to progress sustainable development. They could be tested with other types of land managers and as a foundation on which to build a more comprehensive understanding of sustainable development."

    content="Employment and social inclusion have been regular themes in the agenda of the European Union for the past fifteen years. From a soft coordinated approach mainly focused on the fight against unemployment, the European Union has moved towards a more coordinated but still voluntary strategy for its Member States and this agenda now has multiple economic, social and environmental objectives. A constant feature of these strategies has been the use of education and training policies, in particular for young people who are at risk of social exclusion. This paper reviews the relevant agenda of the European Union and presents the concept of second chance schools initiated by the European Commission in 1995. It seeks to understand how the elements associated with these youth and the policy-makers are combined in order to achieve success in terms of job opportunities and better inclusion for young people."
